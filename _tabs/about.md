Hi my name is Alexander Weber, a passionate computer engineering student based in Finland. My fascination with technology has led me down an exciting path of exploration, where I constantly tinker with various projects in my homelab.

Currently pursuing my studies at Ã…bo Akademi University, I am deeply immersed in the world of computer engineering. This academic journey has provided me with a solid foundation and a comprehensive understanding of the underlying principles and technologies that power our digital world.

One of my greatest joys comes from building and experimenting with different projects. My homelab serves as a creative playground where I can explore various hardware configurations, experiment with cutting-edge software, and develop my skills as a developer. It's a space where imagination takes flight, and I bring my ideas to life.

This website serves as a platform for sharing my passion projects and experiences.Through my blog posts, I hope to inspire fellow technology enthusiasts, students, and anyone curious about the ever-evolving landscape of computer engineering. I firmly believe in the power of knowledge sharing and community engagement, and I hope to contribute to the community through my blog posts.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you find inspiration and value in my projects and blog posts.
