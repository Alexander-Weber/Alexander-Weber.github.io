## What I use
I started with a [Ubiquiti UniFi AP AC Lite](https://store.ui.com/us/en/collections/unifi-wifi-flagship-compact/products/uap-ac-lite) and ran the UniFi Controller on my pc, but when I started using [Unraid](/posts/unraid), I moved the controller to a docker container.

I was considering [UniFi USG](https://store.ui.com/us/en/collections/unifi-accessory-tech-hosting-and-gateways-small-scale/products/usg) router, but I chose [pfSense](/posts/pfsense) instead because of its customizability.
