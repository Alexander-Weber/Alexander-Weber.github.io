## What i use Unraid for?
I use Unraid as my main server OS. I run most my docker containers and VMs on it. I also use it as a NAS for my media and backups.
I have over 25 docker containers and a few VMs running on it. Some of them are:

* [Heimdall](https://heimdall.site/)
* [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/)
* [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)
* [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/)
* [Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/)
* [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/)
* [TailScale](https://tailscale.com/)
* [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/)
* [Unifi Controller](https://www.ui.com/software/)
* [Krusader](https://krusader.org/)
* [tdarr](https://home.tdarr.io/)
* [MeTube](https://github.com/alexta69/metube)
* Some game servers and other containers

I also run a few VMs on it:

* Tiny11 (a small Windows 11 os without bloatware and can be run on much lower specs than the official Windows 11)
* Uuntu 22.04 running [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org/) for log management. [My article](/_posts/2023-05-14-graylog.md).
